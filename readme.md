#Simple Server Info
 A simple PHP 7.0+ class to provide system information about your server/system build. 
 Made with efficency and simplicity in mind. 
 Information is read from the virtual filesystem "/proc" on Unix systems, as such Procfs is required. 
 Most Linux distro's should support this. Windows and OSX is not supported.",
